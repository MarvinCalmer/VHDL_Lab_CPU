2. REPORT DETAILS

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 BLOCKRAM/Memory_reg has an input control pin BLOCKRAM/Memory_reg/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: BLOCKRAM/Q[3]) which is driven by a register (IR/S_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 BLOCKRAM/Memory_reg has an input control pin BLOCKRAM/Memory_reg/ADDRARDADDR[4] (net: BLOCKRAM/Q[0]) which is driven by a register (IR/S_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
